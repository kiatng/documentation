How to Delete Tasks
===================

You can delete a task either through the ``DELETE`` operation available for all entities by default or through the customized one. When running ``DELETE``, ensure that your entity has a route from the ``routeName`` option of the entity configuration.

For more details on how to delete tasks properly or create your own delete operation, refer to the :ref:`Deleting Entities <book-crud-delete>` section.
