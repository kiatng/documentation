Configuration Extras
====================

.. contents:: :local:

Overview
--------

The configuration extras are the way to get varying configuration information.

There are two types of the configuration extras:

-  a configuration extra that is used to request additional configuration options for existing configuration sections. This extra is represented by ``Oro\Bundle\ApiBundle\Config\ConfigExtraInterface``.
-  a configuration extra that is used to request additional configuration section. This extra is represented by ``Oro\Bundle\ApiBundle\Config\ConfigExtraSectionInterface``.

The both types of the configuration extras works in the following way:

-  The actions like :ref:`get <web-api--actions>`, :ref:`get\_list <web-api--actions>` or :ref:`delete <web-api--actions>` register the configuration extras in the :ref:`Context <web-api--actions>` using the ``addConfigExtra`` method. All required extras must be registered before any of the ``getConfig``, ``getConfigOf``, ``getConfigOfFilters`` or ``getConfigOfSorters`` methods of the Context is called. Typically the registration happens in processors from
   ``initialize`` group. For example `InitializeConfigExtras <https://github.com/oroinc/platform/tree/master/src/Oro/Bundle/ApiBundle/Processor/Get/InitializeConfigExtras.php>`__.
-  When some processor needs a configuration it calls appropriate method of the :ref:`Context <web-api--actions>`. For example ``getConfig``, ``getConfigOf``, ``getConfigOfFilters`` or ``getConfigOfSorters``. The first call of any of these methods causes the loading of the configuration.
-  The loading of the configuration is performed by the :ref:`get\_config <web-api--actions>` action. Any of processors registered for this action can check which configuration data is requested and will do suitable work. There are two ways how a processor can find out which configuration data is requested. The first is to use the :ref:`processor conditions <web-api--processors>`. The second one is to use the ``hasExtra`` method of the
   `ConfigContext <https://github.com/oroinc/platform/tree/master/src/Oro/Bundle/ApiBundle/Processor/Config/ConfigContext.php>`__.

Also, please take a look into :ref:`Configuration Reference <web-api--configuration>` for more details about config structure, sections, properties etc.

ConfigExtraInterface
--------------------

The `ConfigExtraInterface <https://github.com/oroinc/platform/tree/master/src/Oro/Bundle/ApiBundle/Config/ConfigExtraInterface.php>`__ has the following methods:

-  **getName** - Returns a string which is used as unique identifier of configuration data.
-  **getCacheKeyPart** - Returns a string that should be added to a cache key used by `configuration providers <https://github.com/oroinc/platform/tree/master/src/Oro/Bundle/ApiBundle/Provider/AbstractConfigProvider.php>`__. In most cases this method returns the same value as the ``getName`` method. But some more complicated extras can build the cache key part based on own properties, e.g.
   `MaxRelatedEntitiesConfigExtra <https://github.com/oroinc/platform/tree/master/src/Oro/Bundle/ApiBundle/Config/MaxRelatedEntitiesConfigExtra.php>`__.
-  **configureContext** - This method can be used to add additional values into the `ConfigContext <https://github.com/oroinc/platform/tree/master/src/Oro/Bundle/ApiBundle/Processor/Config/ConfigContext.php>`__. For example, the mentioned above `MaxRelatedEntitiesConfigExtra <https://github.com/oroinc/platform/tree/master/src/Oro/Bundle/ApiBundle/Config/MaxRelatedEntitiesConfigExtra.php>`__ adds the maximum number of related entities into the context of the
   :ref:`get\_config <web-api--actions>` action and this value is used by the `SetMaxRelatedEntities <https://github.com/oroinc/platform/tree/master/src/Oro/Bundle/ApiBundle/Processor/Config/GetConfig/SetMaxRelatedEntities.php>`__ processor to make necessary modifications to the configuration.
-  **isPropagable** - Indicates whether this config extra should be used when a configuration of related entities will be built. For example `DescriptionsConfigExtra <https://github.com/oroinc/platform/tree/master/src/Oro/Bundle/ApiBundle/Config/DescriptionsConfigExtra.php>`__ is propagable and it means that we will get human-readable descriptions of main entity and all the related entities. If this extra was not propagable the descriptions of main entity would be returned.

ConfigExtraSectionInterface
---------------------------

The `ConfigExtraSectionInterface <https://github.com/oroinc/platform/tree/master/src/Oro/Bundle/ApiBundle/Config/ConfigExtraSectionInterface.php>`__ extends `ConfigExtraInterface <https://github.com/oroinc/platform/tree/master/src/Oro/Bundle/ApiBundle/Config/ConfigExtraInterface.php>`__ and has one additional method:

-  **getConfigType** - Returns the configuration type that should be loaded into this section. This string is used by `ConfigLoaderFactory <https://github.com/oroinc/platform/tree/master/src/Oro/Bundle/ApiBundle/Config/ConfigLoaderFactory.php>`__ to find the appropriate loader.

There is a list of existing configuration extras that implement this interface:

-  `FiltersConfigExtra <https://github.com/oroinc/platform/tree/master/src/Oro/Bundle/ApiBundle/Config/FiltersConfigExtra.php>`__
-  `SortersConfigExtra <https://github.com/oroinc/platform/tree/master/src/Oro/Bundle/ApiBundle/Config/SortersConfigExtra.php>`__

Example of configuration extra
------------------------------

Let's take a look into `DescriptionsConfigExtra <https://github.com/oroinc/platform/tree/master/src/Oro/Bundle/ApiBundle/Config/DescriptionsConfigExtra.php>`__ which is used to request human-readable descriptions of entities and its' fields.

.. code:: php

    <?php

    namespace Oro\Bundle\ApiBundle\Config;

    use Oro\Bundle\ApiBundle\Processor\Config\ConfigContext;

    class DescriptionsConfigExtra implements ConfigExtraInterface
    {
        const NAME = 'descriptions';

        public function getName()
        {
            return self::NAME;
        }

        public function configureContext(ConfigContext $context)
        {
            // no any modifications of the ConfigContext is required
        }

        public function isPropagable()
        {
            return true;
        }

        public function getCacheKeyPart()
        {
            return self::NAME;
        }
    }

Usually configuration extras are added to the Context by ``InitializeConfigExtras`` processors which belong to ``initialize`` group, e.g. `InitializeConfigExtras <https://github.com/oroinc/platform/tree/master/src/Oro/Bundle/ApiBundle/Processor/Get/InitializeConfigExtras.php>`__ processor for ``get`` action. But human-readable descriptions are required only for generation documentation for Data API. So,
`DescriptionsConfigExtra <https://github.com/oroinc/platform/tree/master/src/Oro/Bundle/ApiBundle/Config/DescriptionsConfigExtra.php>`__ is added by `RestDocHandler <https://github.com/oroinc/platform/tree/master/src/Oro/Bundle/ApiBundle/ApiDoc/RestDocHandler.php>`__.

The processor which adds descriptions for entity, fields and filters is `CompleteDescriptions <https://github.com/oroinc/platform/tree/master/src/Oro/Bundle/ApiBundle/Processor/Config/Shared/CompleteDescriptions.php>`__. This processor is registered as services in `processors.get\_config.yml <https://github.com/oroinc/platform/tree/master/src/Oro/Bundle/ApiBundle/Resources/config/processors.get_config.yml>`__. Please note, the processor tag contains the ``extra`` attribute with ``descriptions&definition`` value. This means that the processor will be executed only if the
extra configuration (in this case ``description`` and ``definition``) were requested. For more details see :ref:`processor conditions <web-api--processors>`.
