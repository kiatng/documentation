MS Exchange Integration
=======================

OroCRM application supports integration with Microsoft Exchange server. This means that emails from mailboxes on the MS Exchange server can be automatically uploaded to your Oro application.

.. note:: This feature is only available in the Enterprise edition.

Prerequisites for the Integration
---------------------------------

To set up an integration between your Oro application and MS Exchange Server, make sure that:
 
* Your MS Exchange Server version is 2007 or newer.
* The administrator of the Microsoft Exchange Server account has created at least one user with the permission to impersonate the necessary accounts on the related Exchange Server (super-user).

.. note:: The impersonation procedure may be different depending on the  MS Exchange version you use. More information on this is described in detail in the `Microsoft API and Reference Catalog <https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library>`_ and the `Configure Impersonation <https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/exchange/client-developer/exchange-web-services/how-to-configure-impersonation>`_ article.
